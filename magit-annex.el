;;; Commentary:
;;
;; magit-annex adds a few git annex operations to the magit interface.
;;
;; The main feature is the ability to add files to the annex from the
;; status buffer.
;;
;;   @a   Add a file to annex.
;;        Behaves similarly to staging a file with 's'.
;;
;;   @A   Add all untracked files and unstaged changes to annex.
;;        Behaves similarly to staging all files with 'S'.
;;
;; '@' was chosen as a leading key mostly to be consistent with John
;; Wiegley's git-annex.el [1], but also because there aren't too many
;; single letters available in the magit keymap.
;;
;; There are also options to run a few other git annex commands:
;;
;;   @y   Run `git annex sync'.
;;   m@   Run `git annex merge' (under the merging menu).
;;   P@g  Push git annex branch (under the pushing menu).
;;   P@b  Push current and git annex branch (under the pushing menu).
;;
;; For other git annex commands (e.g., getting, copying, and unlocking
;; annexed files), see git-annex.el [1], which integrates nicely with
;; dired.
